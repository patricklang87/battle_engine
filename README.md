# battle_engine
# I began this projet as a way of exploring the usage of objects in javascript and added some functionality. A couple of further ideas for this project: (1)make the reset button functional, (2)work on improving the css grid, (3)organizing the characters through constructors rather than individual objects, (4)creating a random battle generator in which one fights multiple enemies, (5)enabling the player to create his or her own character. I had initially considered adding animations, but set this aside because it is tangential to my bigger project of becoming familiar with programming.
# I set this project aside to learn more about databases, but was then sidetracked as my interest grew in NLP and Python
